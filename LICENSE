EMail privacy
We will not give away your emails to another organisation or company.

Password privacy
Your password is stored as an obfuscated and salted SHA1 hash, and is censored in the WeChall logs.
Though we don't know the plaintext of your password, in theory it would be possible to crack the hashes if someone gained access to the database and the secret salt.
Thus we encourage you to not use your WeChall password on another site, and choose a password that is strong enough to not get cracked.

Private messages currently occur in the logs, and thus can be read by administrators of this site.
If you need to send really private stuff to some member, we suggest to use another way of communication.

Linked Content
WeChall is not responsible for any content that is linked within the site.
